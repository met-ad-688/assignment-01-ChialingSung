# **Assignment 01 - Counting Python & GitHub Mentions**  
**Author**: Chialing Sung    

##  Description
This assignment involves working with Stack Overflow data to count the number of occurrences of the words **"Python"** and **"GitHub"** in large datasets. We use a **Bash script** (`count_python.sh`) for counting "Python" mentions and a **Python script** (`count_github.py`) for counting "GitHub" mentions.
